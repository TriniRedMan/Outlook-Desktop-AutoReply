# Outlook-Desktop-AutoReply
To Autoreply to Mutilpe Boxes or Profiles on Outlook for Desktop
 Good day all, I created this app to help me AutoRely to multiple profiles for my company i.e they would have a seperate profile/ box for qeuries, purchases, help, etc.
 It is written in python and what it does is to open each profile, reply to unread mails, flag them and the open the next profile/box and continue the process.
 
 What makes this different from Normal Auto Reply is that is a client send alot of emails, Outlook will flag is as potential spam and may not give them AutoReply. 
 
 Please see reasons why AutoReply may not work

 Automatic Replies (OOF) enabled but it is not replying
I've enabled my Automatic Replies (Out of Office) and have sent myself a message from my private account to see how it would arrive. Sadly, I never received this automatic reply.

Why isn't it working and how can I make it work reliably?

Automatic Replies buttonWhen it comes to enabling the Automatic Replies (OOF) feature there are 3 things to note;

By default, it doesnâ€™t reply to people outside of your organization.
It only replies once per address.
It could get filtered out by Junk Email Filters.
In addition, note that it is an Exchange account feature. To get similar functionality for POP3 and IMAP accounts see this guide instead."

I needed AutoReply multiple times from the same address.
